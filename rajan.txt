Abstract:
The test results showcases the escalation in the performance of the websocket over the ajax in terms of data distribution per millisecond.

2.7 Mobile Communication: Android

2.7.1 JSR 356
JSR 356 is a java based application interface used to integrate websocket in both client
and sever side.Any android client can communicate with the server in the websocket approach using JSR356.It enables the android client to initiate a connection and equips the server so that it awaits connections from all the peers and both the sides are very well equipped with callback listeners such as onOpen,onMessage and onClose. 


Data Exchange
In our test scenario we used REST application interface to provide a connectivity between 
server and the client.REST represents Representational State Transfer is basically a 
stateless,cacheable,client-server communication protocol.The main aim of REST application 
interface in this test scenario is to covert the user data into jason objects and it is very simple in nature when compared to the other protocols in terms of implementations like request handling and responding.

Characteristics
The REST application interface have the following characteristics such as 

Platform Independent - it can run on any operating system.

Language Independent - can be integrated with different programming languages.

Easy implementation - less cumbersome in terms of functionality.

Load balancer - can handle heavy loads of data traffic between the network peers.

Secured - Can be made sure by implementing SSH key as token


Traditional vs Unconventional:
Typically REST application interface is implemented by integrating http protocol and it is considered as a simple interface. Our approach is based on the innovative process of integrating websocket with the REST application interface during data communication phase 
between the server and the different types of clients.
